A HHS+ clone, rewritten in Qt/C++


This is work in progress - not playable yet..


If you want to help, git clone the repository, and send a pull request when you have something.

You need to download the HHS+ package and link the HHS+ Schools directory in the Il_principle project directory.

To compile, import the project in Qt creator, build and run. See Qt requirements:

http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/supported-platforms.html

Of course you also need a C++ compiler, just follow the links for your OS. Also required is qt5-charts:
